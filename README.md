dt-date_range_filter
====================

This script can be used along with Datatables jQuery plug-in to filter any date column based on a date-range

Overview:

This function can be used to filter any datatables column with date values. You can select the range by using two date-pickers to get the min and max values. You might have to change the function a bit to make it work for different date formats. By default, the function will filter the third datatables column(index=2)which has date in format mm/dd/yyyy
